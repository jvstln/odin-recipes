  <h2>How to make Salmon Caesar Salad the healthy way</h2>
  <p>This salmon Caesar salad, with Romaine lettuce, topped with cold salmon, toasted croutons, and a homemade Caesar dressing, will be the salad you will make all summer long.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>    
    <li>1 (8 ounce) salmon</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons oil</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons honey</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>3 anchovies</li>
    <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    <li>2 slices day-old bread, cut into cubes</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
    <li>1 head Romaine lettuce, torn into bite-sized pieces</li>
    <li>shaved Parmesan cheese for garnish</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Set a nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Heat 2 teaspoons oil until it shimmers. Add salmon, skin side down. Brush with honey; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover and cook for 4 minutes.</li>
    <li>Carefully flip salmon and reduce the heat to medium. Continue cooking until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes more. Remove salmon to a plate or container; cover and refrigerate until very cold, at least 2 hours.</li>
    <li>For dressing, crack an egg into a food processor. Add lemon juice, Worcestershire, Dijon, garlic, anchovies, grated Parmesan and black pepper; pulse to combine. With food processor running, drizzle in oil until mixture emulsifies. Refrigerate dressing until needed.</li>
    <li>For croutons, melt butter in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add bread cubes; sprinkle with Italian seasoning and granulated garlic.</li>
    <li>Toast until croutons are browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; set aside.</li>
    <li>For salad, add lettuce to a large bowl. Flake salmon with a fork into bite-sized pieces and add to the bowl. Drizzle with Caesar dressing; top with croutons and shaved Parmesan.</li>
  </ol>
